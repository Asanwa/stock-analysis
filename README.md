# stock-analysis
##Purpose 
This VBA macro aims to help Steve analyze the performance of DQ stock on its own and in relation to other stocks on the market between 2017 and 2018. 
The macro makes it easy to determine the total daily volume and yearly return of each stock on the market. 
By accessing these numbers, with total daily volume, Steve can determine how interested people are in DQs stock relative to other stocks and using yearly return DQ stock; he can tell how well DQ stock is performing over time or in comparison to other investment options. 

##Results 
From running our macro and analyzing the information on stocks between 2017 and 2018, we find that, in 2017, just like most other stocks on the market, DQ stock has a percentage negative return rate. 
While in 2018, like other market stocks, DQ stock had a positive percentage return rate. 
This analysis shows that DQ performed poorly at a -66.6% rate in 2017 and highly at 167.4% in 2018, summing up to a growth of 100.8% between 2017 and 2018.
Our analysis also shows that in 2017 DQ stock had the lowest volume traded among other stocks, as summarized in the resource folder table. Although in 2018, the daily volume traded increased from 35,796,200 to 107,873,900, this value was still lower than the daily value traded of most other shares. 
This information is presented in the stock analysis table reference file.

The graphs in the recourses folder plot the relationship between daily volume traded and yearly return for all the stocks included in the workbook. 
From this graph, we learn that the information in this sheet is not enough to determine that higher volume traded directly results in higher yearly return, this is true in 2017 for TERP stock that records the highest annual return, but a low daily volume traded and for SPWR which has the highest daily volume traded but still has a negative yearly return value.
We find similar instances in 2018 for DQ with a relatively lower daily volume traded compared to other investments but the highest annual return rate, but ENPH stock that records the highest volume traded also records the lowest yearly returns (one of the only negative percentage return rates on the market).
The VBA refactored script took 0.55 seconds to run for 2017 and 0.31 to run for 2018. 

##Summary 
The general benefit of refactoring any code is that it makes it easier to understand and Identify errors or even improve the code results. 
However, one disadvantage of refactoring code is that refactoring can be confusing and time-consuming.


Refactoring the code used in this analysis makes it easier to correct and find mistakes within my macro. 
In addition, refactoring this script makes it easier to understand and performs the analysis with less time. 
The disadvantage of this is that refactoring code takes time and is complex/confusing for a beginner like me.
